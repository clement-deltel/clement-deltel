## ✨ About Me

I am a Software Developer with 5+ years of experience in developing enterprise applications and open-source software.

My projects are released as open-source on GitHub, and here are some highlights:

- [Home Server](https://github.com/clement-deltel/home-server): I have been part of the self hosting community for about 5 years now, and it's genuinely transformed how I think about technology, privacy, and digital autonomy. What started as curiosity about running a single service has evolved into an homelab ecosystem of 30+ services, with some that have changed my life. There's something deeply rewarding about having complete control over your own data and infrastructure.
- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/clement-deltel/dotfiles)
- [Python Template Project](https://github.com/clement-deltel/python-boilerplate)

Among the things that I am learning, here are the serious objectives for the foreseeable future:

- **Kubernetes**: more in-depth knowledge to pass the [Certified Kubernetes Application Develop (CKAD)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad) certification
- **Google Cloud Platform**: basic knowledge to pass the [Cloud Digital Leader](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-digital-leader) certification and probably the [Cloud Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-engineer) certification down the line
- **Terraform**: more in-depth knowledge to pass the [HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate](https://developer.hashicorp.com/certifications/infrastructure-automation) certification
- **Oracle Database**: more in-depth knowledge to pass the [Oracle Database SQL Certified Associate](https://education.oracle.com/oracle-database-sql/pexam_1Z0-071) certification
